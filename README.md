# OpenConnect System

OpenConnect is a modular transaction processing system designed for secure and validated communication between Digital Financial Service Providers (DFSPs). The system comprises three main components: **Web Service Interface**, **Queue Processor**, and **Rest Handler**, along with front-end and mobile interfaces for back-office and end-user interactions.

## Components

- **Web Service Interface**  
   - The entry point for transactions, applying security and validation checks.
   - Forwards validated transactions to the Queue Processor.
